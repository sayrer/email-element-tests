# email-element-tests
Testing the HTML Email Input Element

The tests run in Chrome, WebKit, and Firefox. I don't care what they do, but they should all do the same thing.

This is tracked in the WHATWG github here:

https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11803

## Installation

These require [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
